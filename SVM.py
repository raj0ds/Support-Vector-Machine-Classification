# Objectives¶
# After completing this lab you will be able to:

# Use scikit-learn to Support Vector Machine to classify
# In this notebook, you will use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.

# SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong.

# Load the Cancer data
# The example is based on a dataset that is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Asuncion and Newman, 2007)[http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html]. The dataset consists of several hundred human cell sample records, each of which contains the values of a set of cell characteristics. The fields in each record are:

!wget -O cell_samples.csv https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/data/cell_samples.csv
  
#  Load Data From CSV File
cell_df = pd.read_csv("cell_samples.csv")
cell_df.head()
# The ID field contains the patient identifiers. The characteristics of the cell samples from each patient are contained in fields Clump to Mit. The values are graded from 1 to 10, with 1 being the closest to benign.

# The Class field contains the diagnosis, as confirmed by separate medical procedures, as to whether the samples are benign (value = 2) or malignant (value = 4).

# Let's look at the distribution of the classes based on Clump thickness and Uniformity of cell size:
ax = cell_df[cell_df['Class'] == 4][0:50].plot(kind='scatter', x='Clump', y='UnifSize', color='DarkBlue', label='malignant');
cell_df[cell_df['Class'] == 2][0:50].plot(kind='scatter', x='Clump', y='UnifSize', color='Yellow', label='benign', ax=ax);
plt.show()

# Data pre-processing and selection¶
# Let's first look at columns data types:
cell_df.dtypes

# It looks like the BareNuc column includes some values that are not numerical. We can drop those rows:
cell_df = cell_df[pd.to_numeric(cell_df['BareNuc'], errors='coerce').notnull()]
cell_df['BareNuc'] = cell_df['BareNuc'].astype('int')
cell_df.dtypes
cell_df.tail()

feature_df = cell_df[['Clump', 'UnifSize', 'UnifShape', 'MargAdh', 'SingEpiSize', 'BareNuc', 'BlandChrom', 'NormNucl', 'Mit']]
X = np.asarray(feature_df)
X[0:5]

# We want the model to predict the value of Class (that is, benign (=2) or malignant (=4)). As this field can have one of only two possible values, we need to change its measurement level to reflect this.
cell_df['Class'] = cell_df['Class'].astype('int')
y = np.asarray(cell_df['Class'])
y [0:5]

# Train/Test dataset
# We split our dataset into train and test set:
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=4)
print ('Train set:', X_train.shape,  y_train.shape)
print ('Test set:', X_test.shape,  y_test.shape)

# Modeling (SVM with Scikit-learn)
# The SVM algorithm offers a choice of kernel functions for performing its processing. Basically, mapping data into a higher dimensional space is called kernelling. The mathematical function used for the transformation is known as the kernel function, and can be of different types, such as:

# 1.Linear
# 2.Polynomial
# 3.Radial basis function (RBF)
# 4.Sigmoid
# Each of these functions has its characteristics, its pros and cons, and its equation, but as there's no easy way of knowing which function performs best with any given dataset. We usually choose different functions in turn and compare the results. Let's just use the default, RBF (Radial Basis Function) for this lab.

clf = svm.SVC(kernel='rbf')

# After being fitted, the model can then be used to predict new values:

# You can also easily use the f1_score from sklearn library:
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
f1_score(y_test, yhat, average='weighted') 

# Let's try the jaccard index for accuracy:
from sklearn.metrics import jaccard_score
jaccard_score(y_test, yhat,pos_label=2)

# Practice
# Can you rebuild the model, but this time with a __linear__ kernel? You can use __kernel='linear'__ option, when you define the svm. How the accuracy changes with the new kernel function?
# write your code here
